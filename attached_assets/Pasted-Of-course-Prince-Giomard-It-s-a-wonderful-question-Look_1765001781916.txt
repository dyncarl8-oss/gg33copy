Of course, Prince Giomard. It's a wonderful question. Looking at your core and name numbers is like looking at the unique energetic blueprint you were born with. Let's explore what they reveal.

Your **core numbers**, which come from your birth date, speak to the fundamental essence of who you are.
*   Your **Life Path is 4**. This means at your very soul's level, you are a builder. You're here to create things of lasting value, whether that's a stable family, a meaningful career, or a secure community. Your journey is one of dedication, structure, and bringing order to chaos.
*   Your **Day of Birth is 1**. This points to your natural talents. You have an innate spirit of a leader and an innovator. You're independent, driven, and meant to carve your own path.
*   Your **Attitude is 7**. This is how you approach the world—with a thoughtful, analytical, and truth-seeking mind. You're not satisfied with surface-level answers and have a natural wisdom about you.

Then we have your **name numbers**, which reveal how you express yourself and what you truly desire in this life.
*   Your **Expression is 11**. This is a powerful Master Number, indicating you have a direct line to intuition and inspiration. You have the potential to be a channel for profound ideas, art, or spiritual insights. It's a highly sensitive and creative energy.
*   Your **Soul Urge is 4**. This beautifully reinforces your Life Path. Your deepest desire is for security, stability, and a solid foundation. You're motivated by a need to know that you and your loved ones are safe and grounded.
*   Your **Personality is 7**. This mirrors your Attitude number. Others see you as intelligent, perhaps a bit mysterious or reserved, and someone who possesses a deep inner world. They sense your wisdom and are drawn to your unique perspective.

What's so fascinating here, Prince Giomard, is the beautiful alignment in your energy. The builder and the seeker are woven together, guided by a highly intuitive and innovative spirit. It's a powerful combination for creating a life that is not only stable and secure but also deeply meaningful.
